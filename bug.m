In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management. If an observer is not removed when it's no longer needed, it could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior, particularly when the observed object is deallocated.

Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... observation logic ...
}
@end

int main() {
    MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
    [myObject addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"myString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
    // ... some code ...
    myObject = nil; // myObject is released here 
    return 0;
}
```

The `MyObserver` adds itself as an observer, but it's not removed after use.  When `myObject` is released (set to `nil`), it's deallocated.  However, `MyObserver` still holds a strong reference to it (implicitly via the KVO mechanism), which prevents `myObject`'s complete deallocation, resulting in a dangling pointer and potential crashes when `MyObserver` attempts to access deallocated memory.
